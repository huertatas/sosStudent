### Start Metro

First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run npx react-native start inside your React Native project folder:

```
npx react-native start
```

### Start your application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal inside your React Native project folder. Run the following:

```
npx react-native run-android
```
